          <h1>Why this issue needs to be discussed?</h1>
        <p class="lead">This rising issue needs to be discussed so that people can understand there’s need of  resources for mental health to be accessible, available and affordable. Resources should be handy so that lives can be saved and people can cope up with their problems because prevention is better than cure. 
Problem in this area is due to :-
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Financial barriers to mental healthcare</strong> is a major deciding factor. The cost of treatment limits access to mental health services. This creates problems in further two cases: either people are not able to afford treatment at all or they are not able to continue treatment.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Lack of mental health professionals</strong> makes it very hard for someone to look for good treatment and assistance. Rural areas have almost no mental healthcare providers whereas in urban areas, there are long waiting lists in clinics which makes the patients suffer for months before they get an appointment. Moreover, fewer doctors are choosing mental health as their speciality which is a huge gap between the problem and the solution.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Mental health education and awareness</strong> is still inadequate in the society and people often have the fear to be judged if they open up about their problems. Mental illnesses are often hard to recognise which is why they need more awareness. Many people dismiss clinical anxiety as “worrying too much” or depression as “laziness or fatigue”. These problems can be solved if people are educated.</li>
    
    <li> <strong>Social stigma of mental health conditions</strong> prevents people from accessing treatment. At one end, their own beliefs about mental illness can prevent them from acknowledging their illness. On the other end, the risk of being judged by others and facing social discrimination also creates a huge barrier. </li>
          
</ul>
          <h1>How does it affect people’s mental health?</h1>
<ul>
    
   <li>	People don’t get the professional help they deserve which forces them to rely on friends for seeking help. Many times this can be misleading as none of our friends are mental health professionals who can help us effectively.
    </li><li>Many people continue to walk in the path of self destruction and choose self harm and suicide as an option over life.
    </li><li>They completely isolate themselves from the society and start living in constant solitude which can affect their mental health more in a negative way.
    </li><li>This leads to lack of concentration, productivity and leads to more lethargy and numb feeling.
    </li><li>Patients of mental illness become victims of low self esteem and under confidence.</li>

          
</ul>
